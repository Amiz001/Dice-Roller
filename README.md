# Dice Roller 🎲

**Dice Roller** is a fun and interactive game created using **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**. The user selects a guess, rolls the dice, and if the dice matches the guess, the score increments. The game features a **nice UI design** and **sound effects** to make it more engaging.  

> This is one of my early fun coding projects, built purely with frontend technologies and deployed on Netlify.
